    "- In order to use Twitter API, which is a rich resource of data from Twitter, I had to apply for developer account with Twitter. The application process requeres one to provide detailed description of the project and intention for the project. However, after being approved one recives the opportunity to use data and to create apps. \n",
    "- Tweepy is very useful, easy-to-use Python library for Twitter API. It allows a developer to query the data from Twitter to store it into CSV file. \n",

    "- Scores were misleading at first because they contained strange denumerators not equal to 10 or very large numerators . But after closer investigaition I found that it was due to retweets, pictures containing multiple dogs, and numerators containing decimal values. \n",
    "- Dog stages defined by the dictionary(Doggo, Floofer, Puppo, Pupper) of WeRateDogs were places in separate columns, and had to be combined into one column that I called \"dog_stages "
